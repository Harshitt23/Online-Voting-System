# Online-Voting-System

        Introduction --
Online voting system is a digital platform that allows people to cast their vote from the comfort of their own home. It is a secure and efficient way of voting, as it eliminates the need for physical ballots and manual counting.

This system provides a convenient and secure way for citizens to participate in elections, as it reduces the need for physical presence at polling stations and ensures that votes are counted accurately.

        Objective --
The main objective of this project is to use programming languages like PHP and HTML and by the help of these we can make online voting system project in a way that’s systematic and verifiable.
It’s a good idea to use an online voting system to:
Increased Efficiency
One of the most significant advantages of online voting systems is incredible      efficiency. With traditional paper-based voting, there are a lot of steps involved, from printing ballots to counting votes by hand. You can avoid all of that with online voting.
        Improved Accuracy
Another advantage of online voting systems is that they tend to be more accurate than traditional paper-based systems. On the other hand, there's always the potential for human error with paper ballots, whether it's miscounting votes or mixing up ballots.

        Motivation --
Boost participation: As a result of the previous point, choosing online   voting for your election will boost the participation.                                           
You will give the chance to members that otherwise may not be able to vote. 

Less physical infrastructure: When running a voting online, you avoid the need for all the physical infrastructure usually required on a traditional voting. No need of paper, printing, physical urns or staff may, therefore, lead to a lower monetary investment.
